# Inventory-Management-System
Efficiently manage a company's stock of items using generics.
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage a company's stock of items using generics. The system supports three categories of items—Books, Toys, and Stationery—and enables various operations: adding, removing, searching, and displaying items.

Key functionalities include:

Add Operation: Allows adding items with specific attributes 
Remove Operation: Removes an item by its unique barcode if it exists in the inventory.
Search Operations: Facilitates searching for items by barcode or name, providing detailed outputs.
Display Operation: Lists all items in the inventory, organized by category (Books, Toys, and then Stationery).
The program utilizes Java Generics to ensure type safety, reduce code duplication, and enhance reusability, adhering to principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). It processes commands from an input file (commands.txt) and outputs results to an output file (output.txt). This implementation emphasizes clean, maintainable code while providing a robust inventory management solution.
