# Inventory-Management-System
Efficiently manage a company's stock of items using generics.
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage a company's stock of items using generics. The system supports three categories of items—Books, Toys, and Stationery—and enables various operations: adding, removing, searching, and displaying items.

Key functionalities of the inventory management system include adding items with specific attributes, removing items based on their unique barcode if they exist, and searching for items by barcode or name with detailed outputs. Additionally, the system provides a display operation that lists all items in the inventory, organized by categories such as Books, Toys, and Stationery. The program leverages Java Generics to ensure type safety, minimize code duplication, and enhance reusability, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It processes commands from an input file named commands.txt and generates results in an output file named output.txt. This implementation focuses on clean, maintainable code, offering a robust and efficient solution for inventory management.
